# 1. General Analysis Information
analysis_name: "sensor_all_direction_effect"
domain: "sensor"

# 2. Epoch Time Window and Baseline Correction
epoch_window:
  tmin: -0.2
  tmax: 0.496
  baseline: [-0.2, 0.0]

# 3. Contrast Definition
# CRITICAL: Tests main direction effect across FULL 1-6 range (INCLUDING crossovers)
# Directly supports abstract claim: "Decreasing changes...elicited shallower N1 and higher P3b"
# This is the PRIMARY direction contrast - includes all 12 increasing vs all 12 decreasing transitions
contrast:
