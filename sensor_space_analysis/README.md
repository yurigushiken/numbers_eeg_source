Brain-Behavior Correlation Analysis (Left Temporal Cluster vs RT)

This package implements a TDD-driven analysis to link trial-level EEG amplitudes from a left anterior–temporal sensor cluster (Cluster #2) to behavior (reaction time and accuracy).

Run the main analysis:

- `conda activate numbers_eeg_source`
- `python sensor_space_analysis\\run_analysis.py`

Outputs are written under `sensor_space_analysis/outputs/`.
