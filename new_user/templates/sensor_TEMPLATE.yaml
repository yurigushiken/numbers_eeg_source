#
# SENSOR-SPACE ANALYSIS TEMPLATE
# This file defines a scalp EEG analysis comparing two conditions.
#
# QUICK START:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it (e.g., sensor_my_analysis.yaml)
# 2. Change analysis_name (line 8)
# 3. Set your two conditions (lines 22 and 26)
# 4. Run: python -m code.run_full_analysis_pipeline --config <your_file> --accuracy all

# 1. General Analysis Information
analysis_name: "sensor_TEMPLATE"  # ← CHANGE THIS to match your filename (no .yaml extension)
domain: "sensor"  # Always "sensor" for scalp analyses

# 2. Epoch Time Window and Baseline Correction
epoch_window:
  tmin: -0.2        # Start of epoch (200 ms before stimulus)
  tmax: 0.496       # End of epoch (496 ms after stimulus)
  baseline: [-0.2, 0.0]  # Baseline correction window (pre-stimulus period)

# 3. Contrast Definition
# Define what you're comparing: Condition A minus Condition B
contrast:
  name: "Condition A vs. Condition B"  # Human-readable label
  condition_A:
    name: "Condition A"  # Short label for plots
    condition_set_name: "CARDINALITY_1"  # ← CHANGE THIS (see code/condition_sets.yaml for options)
  condition_B:
    name: "Condition B"
    condition_set_name: "CARDINALITY_2"  # ← CHANGE THIS
  combination_weights: [1, -1]  # Keep as-is (A minus B)

# 4. Statistical Analysis Parameters
stats:
  analysis_window: [0.00, 0.496]  # Time range to test (sensor: use full epoch)
  p_threshold: 0.01       # Cluster-forming threshold (0.01 = moderate, 0.05 = liberal, 0.001 = strict)
  cluster_alpha: 0.05     # Final significance level (keep at 0.05)
  n_permutations: 5000    # Number of permutations (5000 = fast, 10000 = more stable)
  tail: 0                 # 0 = two-sided, -1 = A < B, 1 = A > B
  seed: 42                # Random seed for reproducibility (keep at 42)
  connectivity:
    method: "distance"    # How to define neighboring sensors
    threshold: 0.04       # 4 cm threshold for 128-channel cap

  # --- OPTIONAL: Restrict analysis to specific sensor regions (uncomment to use) ---
  # roi:
  #   channel_groups:
  #     - posterior_visual_parietal  # All visual/parietal sensors (25 channels)
  #   # Or specify individual regions:
  #   # - N1_bilateral      # 14 occipital-temporal channels
  #   # - P1_Oz             # 8 parieto-occipital channels
  #   # - P3b_midline       # 9 centro-parietal channels

# 5. Visualization Parameters

  erp:
    channels: []  # Auto-populated by pipeline
  topomap:
    times: []     # Auto-populated by pipeline
